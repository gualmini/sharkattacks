Take this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/felipeesc/shark-attack-dataset(opens in a new tab). Use all the skills you've learned up until now to answer the following questions as well as possible. 

for all questions only rows which included a date were used

1 - What are the most dangerous types of sharks to humans?

The highest number o f retrievable incident (both lethal and nod-lethal) involve white, tiger and bull sharks in this order.
To determine which species is actually more dangerous, we would also need to know which species has more members.
Assumptions: (1) rows which miss a value in the Fatal (Y/N) would show the same distribution
(2) looking at the word preceding the word shark in column "Species "" is a reliable way of identifying the species

2 - Are children more likely to be attacked by sharks?

NO, the percentage of children (classified as children when younger than 13) attacked by a shark is 8.41, which is far
below the percentage of children in the world population
assumptions: 12 is a reasonable cut-ff, string manipulations is correct


3 - Are shark attacks where sharks were provoked more or less dangerous?

based on the contingency table provoked shark attacks are less dangerous.
Assumptions (1) excluded values would not change the distribution, (2) 'unprovoked' is a meaningful concept, which
probably isn't, since being in the water might count as a provocation to begin with

4 - Are certain activities more likely to result in a shark attack?

We can't answer this question since we do not know how many people engaged in the relevant activities in these areas and
were NOT attacked by a shark. These are the top 10 activities mentioned in teh database, in descending order:
['Surfing', 'Swimming', 'Fishing', 'Spearfishing', 'Bathing', 'Wading', 'Diving', 'Standing', 'Snorkeling', 'Scuba diving']
